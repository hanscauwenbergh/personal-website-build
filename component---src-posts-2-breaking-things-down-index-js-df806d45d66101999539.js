Yet, it has become somewhat easier as smartphones usually provide these functions."),(0,o.tZ)("p",null,"Since video games already take place in a virtual world created by a computer, it’s not that difficult to configure the computer to share your view of that virtual world with everyone else around the world.

Therefore, it isn’t surprising at all that most live streams today are about video games."),(0,o.tZ)("p",null,"While most enthusiasts follow traditional sports on television, esports are almost exclusively live streamed on the internet instead of broadcasted on television.

If we present data in a more visual way instead of just plain numbers, humans are able to get an understanding of the data in the fraction of a second.

As a player, the physical skills are often the most important to gain success while the strategies can be worked on with a coach. If we look at chess though, there’s absolutely no need for physical skills, except for being able to move pieces around the board for several hours. The strategy aspect though is far more complex than any traditional physical sport most would argue. Most esports can be situated in between these more extreme positions. They require some physical skill from the players: a swift reaction time and some pretty slick eye-hand coordination, often called mechanics. But even players who possess those skills aren’t guaranteed to have success. As a competitive player you need to have a deeper understanding about the game, desirable moves and the ability to adapt while in game without interference from a coach. While there’s only a handful of rules in soccer and the only state of the game is the position of the ball and the players, the number of variables players need to take into account in esports are often far greater."),(0,o.tZ)("p",null,"With prize pools for esports competitions exceeding 20 million dollars and the peak concurrent viewership surpassing 10 million spectators at the most popular esports competitions, we can safely say esports is becoming an industry on its own."))}}]);
