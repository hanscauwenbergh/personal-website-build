So, who’s responsible for all this building and updating? We could host a web framework on some server and let it do all the heavy lifting but in the end, I’d rather have the clients do the work for me. This can be done by a language that the browser understands, i.e. client-side JavaScript. There are a LOT of different JavaScript frameworks available today for rendering content to a web page but a rather interesting and popular one is ",(0,h.tZ)(r.d,{href:"https://reactjs.org/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener"},"React"),", which is developed and used by Facebook. It’s especially efficient for rendering highly dynamic content because it maintains a virtual version of the DOM. With each update of the content, it determines which elements of the web page in particular need to be rerendered since this rerendering is a very costly operation for browsers. Considering the game data and consequently the content of the web page are updated about every second, the efficiency of the rerendering is quite important and to that end, I decided to implement the whole application in React."),(0,h.tZ)("p",null,"Another important part of the application are the visualisations. The most eminent JavaScript framework for visualisations is ",(0,h.tZ)(r.d,{href:"https://d3js.org/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener"},"D3"),". The basics are simple, yet it allows for extensive customisation. While there are some attempts to come up with a React implementation of everything that D3 offers, they have yet to mature. I found it to be easier to write out the SVG elements myself in React and use the D3 functionality for the scales, area paths, … . This also granted me the freedom to include whatever I wanted in the visualisations."),(0,h.tZ)("p",null,"In the beginning, the styling of the application was quite hacky (plain old CSS and all the issues that come with it).

While inline CSS is usually frowned upon, I only included properties that determine the position and dimensions of elements since they don’t ever need to change while swapping styles.

The data can come directly from a websocket, which is the case when you are using the application to watch a live competitive League of Legends game, or from a JSON file when the game is prerecorded. The data updates can be synchronised to a video, considering the start time of the game in the video is provided, or played back with a timer of desired pace."))}}]);
