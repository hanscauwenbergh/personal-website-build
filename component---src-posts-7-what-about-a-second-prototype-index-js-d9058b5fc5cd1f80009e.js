Although I kind of knew this beforehand, along with the reasons why, I thought to myself that in this case it could serve its purpose. On top of that, I really like circles! Too bad for them, there’s no place for prioritizing aesthetics over clarity here. A fundamental problem with the design of the first prototype was that the gold distribution isn’t that realistically portrayed. As you can see in the second prototype, which uses the real data from the game at that point, the different amounts of gold are actually quite close. If we would adapt the pie charts of the first prototype with these values, they would more or less look like evenly cut pies that gave you a hard time to choose the largest piece from as a child."),(0,l.tZ)("p",null,"At least we can always revert to good old bar charts. They allow the users to estimate differences between players way more precisely and due to their configuration in the second prototype also allow a comparison between players of different teams. Since these bar charts don’t display temporal or differential data, the difference between gold earned and gold spent is added here, again represented with different shades. The visualisation also provides the current difference in gold earned and gold spent between the two teams next to little icons and indicates with a little arrow which team is ahead in each aspect. A disadvantage is that the roles of each player aren’t that clear anymore. This can be solved by displaying the role information on hovering the mouse over the specific bars."),(0,l.tZ)("h3",null,"Damage"),(0,l.tZ)("p",null,"For the sake of consistency, the damage visualisation has taken the same form as the gold visualisation.

The first prototype didn’t include that much information so I should’ve seen that one coming. After some clarification, the testers suggested that it would be useful to also display the factors from which the vulnerability score is calculated. Thus, the second prototype provides the three most influencing factors next to the champion portraits.
