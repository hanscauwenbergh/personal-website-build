It’s actually a combination of different statistics in the game according to some made-up formula to combine them into one single, fictional vulnerability statistic. Some additional background text is added to make the ranking more obvious and to explain the presence of the symbols next to the champion portraits.

The base gold was often overlooked and therefore, it is now combined with the miscellaneous gold from before. Spectators can now clearly see that gold generation forms the bulk of a player’s gold and can compare this to the gold that’s actually earned on the map. A possible disadvantage could be the domination of this bar’s height in the bar chart, resulting in having a harder time to estimate or compare the other values."),(0,r.tZ)("p",null,"After combining the gold difference and sources visualisations, there was plenty of space left in the role specific comparison view. The gold sources visualisation actually has a great analogy in the damage statistic.
