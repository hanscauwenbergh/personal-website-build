Junglers happen to traverse these areas all the time without actually ganking a lane. Therefore, the algorithm needs to take the distance between the jungler and the enemy laner(s) into account as well. If a jungler stays in a lane area and within a distance of 1000 map units of an enemy laner, the algorithm indicates the movement as a valid gank attempt.

If a jungler somehow manages to lure the monsters out of their area without entering the area for 1.5 seconds, it doesn’t get registered.

The other way around, a jungler staying in a camp area for over 1.5 seconds will get registered as clearing the camp, even if it isn’t up. Luckily, this doesn’t happen that often in pro play because junglers don’t like to waste their time."),(0,h.tZ)("p",null,"The clarity of showing the pathings on the map can still be improved tremendously.
