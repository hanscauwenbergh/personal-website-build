As a player, the physical skills are often the most important to gain success while the strategies can be worked on with a coach. If we look at chess though, there’s absolutely no need for physical skills, except for being able to move pieces around the board for several hours. The strategy aspect though is far more complex than any traditional physical sport most would argue. Most esports can be situated in between these more extreme positions. They require some physical skill from the players: a swift reaction time and some pretty slick eye-hand coordination, often called mechanics. But even players who possess those skills aren’t guaranteed to have success. As a competitive player you need to have a deeper understanding about the game, desirable moves and the ability to adapt while in game without interference from a coach.
