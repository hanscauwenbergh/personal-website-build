The former state of the application contained visualisations about the gold and damage. These statistics don’t need processing, they are directly available in the data updates themselves. The information in the proposed vulnerability and jungle pathing visualisations however, needs to be determined in some way based on the data updates as they are not directly given.

While designing the prototype I already figured out what factors should be taken into account: availability of the summoner spells, health, positioning, defensive statistics and mana. Not all of these factors are just as significant though so I weighted them in the following manner:"),(0,f.tZ)(m.Li,{src:n}),(0,f.tZ)("p",null,"The availability of summoner spells was considered the most important with the reasoning that one can still use flash for instance to escape a situation with low health, mana or inferior positioning.

The overall vulnerability formula is linear in the vulnerabilities for the different factors. A player with extraordinary defensive statistics and full health isn’t as vulnerable to their positioning as an ADC is for instance. A nonlinear equation could take these kind of situations into account. The evaluations will have to point out if the more simple, linear approach is sufficient to estimate the vulnerabilities."))}}]);
