The gold difference between two teams is therefore useful to judge which team is currently ahead. In the visualisation, this difference is shown in function of the game time so spectators can clearly see how the actions in-game influence the gold difference over time. The two different shades of the team colours represent the difference between the gold that has been earned by the team and the gold that has already been spent, which is a subtle difference. However, this can make a world of difference in a team fight when one team is fully geared up on items and the other team is still stuck with all their gold in their pockets. Hence, the difference in gold spent arguably gives a more accurate estimation of the current power of both teams. The difference in gold earned is still valuable too though, as it gives spectators insights into the future power of both teams."),(0,h.tZ)("h3",null,"Gold share"),(0,h.tZ)("p",null,"Different teams distribute their gold over their team members in their own way.

However, it’s useful to provide both so the damage dealt to champions during the entire game will be available in the role specific comparison.

Some of the most important ones include: current health, mana, defensive summoner spells being available, their position on the map (distance from team members, enemies, friendly turrets, base, …) and defensive stats of the player.
