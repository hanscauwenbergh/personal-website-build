The gold difference between two teams is therefore useful to judge which team is currently ahead.

The two different shades of the team colours represent the difference between the gold that has been earned by the team and the gold that has already been spent, which is a subtle difference. However, this can make a world of difference in a team fight when one team is fully geared up on items and the other team is still stuck with all their gold in their pockets.

Some of the most important ones include: current health, mana, defensive summoner spells being available, their position on the map (distance from team members, enemies, friendly turrets, base, …) and defensive stats of the player.
